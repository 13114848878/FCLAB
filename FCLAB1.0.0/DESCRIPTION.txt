Supported functions
1. Compute functional connectivity analysis on single subject EEG data
2. Visualize functional connectivity graphs using head (and head-in-head) models
3. Compute various graph and(or) Minimum Spanning Tree local and global parameters
4. Visualize graph and(or) Minimum Spanning Tree parameters using charts and head models

Description
eegplugin_fclab() -> loads the FCLAB options on EEGLAB's interface
fclab_dependences() -> downloads (if necessary) all the required packages for executing graph/MST analysis
pop_fclab() -> loads the FCLAB environment and calls fclab()
pop_fcvisual() -> loads the Graph visualization interface through pop_fcvisual.fig
pop_fcgraph() -> loads the Graph analysis interface and calls fcgraph()
pop_fcvisual_parameters -> loads the Graph/MST parameters visualization interface through pop_fcvisual_parameters.fig
pop_fcvisual_MSTs -> loads the MST visualization interface through pop_fcvisual_MSTs.fig
fclab() -> executes functional connectivity for the selected similarity measure and for the bands of interest
fcgraph() -> computes various local and global parameters for different types of graphs/MSTs through fclab_graphproperties() and fclab_MST()
fclab_graphproperties() -> computes local and global graph parameters for the bands of interest
fclab_MST() -> computes various local and global MST parameters for the bands of interest

Notes
1. All the *.fig files were created using MATLAB's guide
2. EEG epoch data are automatically averaged across the epochs
3. topoplot() and topoplot_connect() are slightly modified versions of eeglab's original ones
